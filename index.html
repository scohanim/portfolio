    <h1>Sami Cohanim</h1>


    <p>I'm a UX/UI Designer based in Chicago with a background in graphic design and social media management. My thriving curiosity about how people interact with and experience content makes UX design a natural fit for me. I am currently pursuing a Master's Degree at Illinois Institute of Design</p>

    <p>I solve problems by deep-diving into human patterns and incorporating my visual communication skills to create efficient solutions.</p>
