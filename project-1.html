    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Searching for SmartLabel pages on smartlabel.org is slow and cumbersome, and not a great showcase for the pages with Label Insight's data. Additionally, there's no way for search engine crawlers to find the vast majority of Label Insight's pages. Consumers are not able to search for a product and find its SmartLabel page. As the product designer, I aimed to solve these problems in a new, user-friendly portal that would live on Label Insight’s website, with the hopes of being approved by the GMA (Grocery Manufacturer’s Association).</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>I started out with some competitive analysis, seeing how other brands were approaching search web applications. I looked into Target, Raley's and Sage Project, and gathered information on what they were doing well and what wasn't working. Through this discovery, I decided that the new SmartLabel portal needed to be modern, simple, and very easily searchable.</p>

    <h2>Target User</h2>
    <p>Most use cases are for someone who wants to go straight to a SmartLabel page from Google and view what's in their products. However, with this new portal, we wanted to target the health-focused consumer who may be shopping at the grocery store and can quickly look something up on their phone, while also being able to discover new products. </p>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>With our target user established, I was ready to get started on the responsive design, creating something simple and user-friendly with an updated modern and fresh look that can be accessible to any kind of consumer. I created a sitemap to establish the order and placement of the pages. </p>
    <p>I decided that the most important element to emphasize would be the search bar. It would live on every page so that looking up products could be as easy for the user as possible. The second design for the search bar was ultimately chosen because it aligned best with the Label Insight brand. </p>
    <p>For the landing page, the featured products and featured brands sections were important to have so that just in case someone does land on the landing page instead of going straight to a SmartLabel page from Google, they could have some room for discovery and be able to browse other products. Originally, I designed this section to have a carousel of products and brands before viewing all, but that could not be engineered in time. </p>
    <p>When I began designing, I included attribute search and filtering in my first iterations since high order attributes are such an important and unique part of what Label Insight does. However, when presenting to the team, it became apparent that the engineers would not be able to implement the attributes and filtering by the time we had to deliver this project. </p>

    <h2>Hi-Fidelity Mockup</h2>

    <h2>The Future of the Smartlabel Directory</h2>
    <p>For future iterations that couldn't make it into this MVP because of time and development constraints, we would definitely include advanced filtering with Label Insight's high order attributes, spin 30 icons on the products we have those capabilities for, and toggle between a card view and table view for easy sorting.</p>
