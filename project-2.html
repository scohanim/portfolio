    <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
    <p>Before our first meeting with the client, we conducted research on the client, the industry, competing, alternative products/services, and 'best-in-class' solutions.</p>
    <p>Based on the research and information we gathered, we determined that in our kickoff meeting with the client we wanted to discuss the following: the client's view on authenticity in interviews, who the future users are, and how the client wants them to use Wedge. After a great meeting, we developed a sense clarity on the purpose Wedge and the client’s vision. We were then able to embark on our three week sprint.</p>

    <h2>Usability Test Findings</h2>
    <p>After testing with 3 different users on Wedge's original platform, we found that users are uncomfortable with hearing themselves in the test playback as well as watching themselves answer questions on the screen, most of our users didn’t understand that “practice position” was an audio and video test, and some users were unclear about when the recording started during their response</p>

    <h2>Target User</h2>
    <p>Figuring out who our first ideal user would be was one of our biggest challenges, especially because the client's idea of who it would be differed from ours based on our research. The client has intended for it to be a college student or recent graduate, but we found that Wedge would be most useful for people who have been working but are seeking a career change. These job seekers are motivated to grow their networks, and since they are applying for jobs in a different field, Wedge could give them that extra (w)edge. We also found through our industry research that it would be most effective at opening opportunities if used in a referral system.</p>

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>For the wireframes, I built a step by step process for the job seeker to get an understanding of the framework, brainstorm, practice their story, and finally film their Wedge. At this time we were referring to the framework as the STAR method, a common technique used in interviewing where you discuss a specific situation you were in, task you had, action you took, and result you created all in one story.</p>

    <h2>Hi-Fidelity Mockup</h2>
    <img src="assets/img/hifi-mockup-wedge.png" alt="sample of webpage within a laptop" width="500">
    <p>The illustration of the Wedge character provides some fun and relief throughout a somewhat stressful process. Since we discovered how uncomfortable people are speaking about themselves, especially in high pressure situations, we felt that this quirky addition that also provides guidance through its own story would alleviate user's apprehensions.</p>
    <p>Since users were so uncomfortable watching themselves as they recorded their Wedge, we decided to remove that feature altogether. We wanted to limit stress as much as possible, so all you see while recording is a blue dot that shrinks as time goes by, rather than having a distracting and nerve-wracking countdown.</p>
