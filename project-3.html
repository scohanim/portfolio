    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>The CTA does not have its own app, let alone an app for safety. The CTA does not provide a safe way to confront a threat. It is so widely used in Chicago, but commuters do not have a clear idea of what to do in a threatening situation.</p>
    <p>Currently on the CTA, there is an emergency call button to contact the conductor. The conductor can then respond over the loudspeaker to see what the problem is, but this is loud and calls attention that could potentially have undesired consequences. If there is an incident, commuters want to avoid confronting the perpetrator and escalating the situation. Victims themselves may also feel embarrassed to ask for help.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
    <p>There are 46 apps that support CTA train tracking, but none of these are owned by CTA. After analyzing the five most popular transit apps, we found they all do the same thing: tell you when the next train is coming.</p>
    <h3>Statistics</h3>
    <p>The serious crimes reported in the increase consist of homicides, robberies, burglaries and rapes (according to the Sun Times' CTA Crime Increase Report).</p>
    <h3>Academic Research</h3>
    <p>One of the key barriers to bystander intervention is The Bystander Effect. There are three key components to the Bystander Effect which include dividing responsibility, fear of being judged by others when acting publicly, and reliance on overt actions of others when defining ambiguous situations. The greater the social cohesion among individuals, the greater the chance of interference.</p>
    <h3>Social Proof</h3>
    <p>We discovered social proof as the concept that to promote a behavior, first you have to normalize and present it as a social norm to get people involved so that if they feel like part of group they're much more likely to act together.</p>

    <h2>User Needs</h2>
    <p>Based off of the research we conducted and users we interviewed, we narrowed down our user needs to the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Our user needs a way to covertly create awareness of a problem by involving the community because he/she is hesitant to get involved alone.</li>
        <li>CTA riders need a way to prompt action in a discreet way because of the CTA's lack of methods to respond in real time.</li>
        <li>Victims of crime need a way to covertly ask for help from the community because they do not want to confront the perpetrator alone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>We believe that by creating a covert communication app that is awareness and community-centric for victims or witnesses of crime on the CTA L Train, we will achieve a safer commute for our users.</p>
    <p>In the app, the user first selects whether he/she is a victim or a bystander of an incident. We decided that the bystander would be led to a page where they can quickly choose what type of incident they see, send out an alert to people in the same train car, and be able to chat about it in a community page. The victim, in a much more urgent situation, would skip these steps and head straight to the community chat to alert others and report the incident, since we found how in so many cases victims are afraid to confront the perpetrator.</p>

    <h2>Hi-Fidelity Mockup</h2>
    <img src="assets/img/cta-mockup-full.png" alt="three screens of cta high fidelity mockup" width="480">
    <p>As the visual desiger, I decided that I would pick similar colors to those of the CTA website so that the brands align visually. I also implemented black as the background for the pages instead of white or a lighter color so that it wouldn't display harshly and draw attention in a situation where users need to be covert. The copy we finally ended up with for the starting page is "Alert Community" for the bystander and "I Need Help" for the victim.</p>
